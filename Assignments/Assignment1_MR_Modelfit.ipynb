    "Firstly, the table shows results for six different models: Logistic RandomRegression, Logistic GridRegression, SVM Random, SVM Grid, Dtree random, and Dtree grid. And all Models : accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were analyzed. Here, we mainly focus on the 'recall' and 'accuracy metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall is an important metric to consider because it measures the proportion of actual positive cases correctly identified by the model. In other words, it evaluates the model's ability to correctly identify all positive cases. A high recall score indicates that the model is able to identify the large percentage of positive cases, whereas a low recall score indicates that the model is missing a large amount of positive cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A high recall score is important in this case because it indicates the model's ability to correctly identify businesses that are likely to fail in the future and therefore require insurance coverage. According to the results, the recall scores for all models range from 0.0845 to 0.0563. This suggests that the models aren't very good at predicting which businesses will fail. Further research is needed to identify the reasons of the low recall scores and to improve the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, from above metrics we can observe \"Accuracy\" score is almost similar for \"logistic regression models\" at 96.43%, \"SVM models\"  at 96.38% and for \"Dtree\" it is 96.5% respectively. We can conclude from the problem statement and the results that accuracy is an important metric in predicting bankruptcies in the IT industry. In order to avoid future losses, the insurance company must identify which businesses are likely to fail. This means that the models can accurately predict whether or not a business will fail.\n",
